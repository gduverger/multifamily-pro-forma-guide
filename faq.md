### Is cash flow calculated after debt service?  

**Yes.** In real estate, “cash flow to equity” (also called *levered cash flow*) is calculated **after debt service** — meaning after subtracting the property’s loan payments (principal and interest) from NOI.  

- **NOI (Net Operating Income):** before debt service, used by lenders to size loans and calculate DSCR.  
- **Cash Flow to Equity:** after debt service, this is what investors actually receive and what’s used in Cash-on-Cash (CoC) return calculations.  

In short: **lenders care about NOI, investors care about cash flow after debt.**
