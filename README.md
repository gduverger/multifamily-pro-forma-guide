# The Ultimate Multifamily Pro Forma Guide

This repository contains a **beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide** to understanding and building a **pro forma for multifamily real estate assets in the United States**.  

The guide is structured in a **pyramid fashion**: starting with the big picture (investment outputs), then working down through the building blocks (NOI, EGI, expenses), and finally arriving at the detailed inputs (rent rolls, financing). Along the way, adjacent concepts, naming conventions, and common controversies are introduced.
