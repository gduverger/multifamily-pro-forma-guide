### Is cash flow calculated after debt service?  

**Yes.** In real estate, “cash flow to equity” (also called *levered cash flow*) is calculated **after debt service** — meaning after subtracting the property’s loan payments (principal and interest) from NOI.  

- **NOI (Net Operating Income):** before debt service, used by lenders to size loans and calculate DSCR.  
- **Cash Flow to Equity:** after debt service, this is what investors actually receive and what’s used in Cash-on-Cash (CoC) return calculations.  

In short: **lenders care about NOI, investors care about cash flow after debt.**

### Why does DSCR use NOI instead of CoC?  

**Because lenders focus on the property’s ability to service debt, not investor returns.** NOI shows cash flow *before* financing, making it the cleanest measure of property performance.  

- **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio):** NOI ÷ Debt Service.  
- **CoC (Cash-on-Cash):** Cash Flow to Equity ÷ Equity Invested.  

**DSCR = lender’s lens; CoC = investor’s lens.**

### What does “underwritten NOI” mean?  

**It’s the lender’s conservative version of NOI.** They apply “haircuts” to rents, other income, and/or inflate expenses to make sure the property can still cover debt under stress.  

- **Sponsor’s Pro Forma NOI:** optimistic forward-looking forecast.  
- **Underwritten NOI:** lender’s adjusted, lower figure for safety.  

**Underwritten NOI = lender’s stress-tested income assumption.**
