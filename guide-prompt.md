# Prompt: Generate the Ultimate Multifamily Pro Forma Guide  

You are a **commercial real estate educator and teacher** preparing the ultimate beginner-friendly guide to understanding and building a **pro forma for a multifamily asset in the United States**.  

The audience is **students and professionals new to real estate**, with no prior background knowledge. The goal is to explain concepts in **plain English first**, then gradually add mathematical detail, and finally show practical examples.

## Overall Structure  

Organize the guide in a **pyramid fashion**:  

- **Top of pyramid**: Begin with the **big picture** — what the pro forma is for, and what questions it helps answer.  
- **Middle layers**: Show the key output metrics (NOI, IRR, DSCR, CoC, Equity Multiple, etc.), then work backward to show how they are calculated.  
- **Bottom of pyramid**: Introduce the inputs (rents, vacancy, operating expenses, financing terms).  
- Along the way, introduce **adjacent concepts** (CapEx reserves, T12 financials, exit cap rates, sensitivity analysis) without going too deep, just so readers recognize the terms.

## Section Requirements  

For **each major concept** (whether an output metric like IRR, an intermediate like NOI, or an input like Rent Roll):  

1. **Why It Matters** — explain in practical, investor- or lender-oriented terms.  
2. **Definition** — a precise, formal explanation.  
3. **Key Terms** — plain-English clarifications of related jargon (e.g., cash flow, vacancy loss, debt service).  
4. **Formula** — written in LaTeX in a code block.  
5. **Excel Equivalent** — show the exact function(s) that replicate the calculation.  
6. **Two Worked Examples** — using realistic multifamily numbers (e.g., a 20-unit suburban property, a 100-unit urban property).  
7. **Naming & Common Controversies** — explain if there are alternate conventions or industry disagreements (e.g., whether reserves are above NOI, Year-1 vs Stabilized CoC, refinance proceeds in EM).  
8. **References** — cite authoritative sources (Investopedia, NAIOP, CCIM Institute, ULI, NCREIF, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, HUD, BOMA, etc.).  
9. **Section Summary & Transition** — conclude with a short recap and preview what comes next in the pyramid (so readers always know where they are).

## Presentation Style  

- Use **professional, descriptive headings** (e.g., “What Net Operating Income (NOI) Really Means for Investors” instead of just “NOI”).  
- Use **plain English first**, then formulas, then worked examples.  
- Keep formulas visually distinct.  
- Include **at least two different numerical examples** for each metric or concept.  
- Explicitly highlight **Key Terms** and **Controversies** to build intuition.  
- Cite **sources and links** to reliable references.

## End Goal  

By the end of the guide, the reader should:  

- Understand **what a pro forma is** and why it matters.  
- Be able to **interpret the top-level investment metrics** (IRR, CoC, EM, DSCR).  
- Know how those metrics are **calculated from building blocks** like NOI, EGI, and expenses.  
- See how **inputs like rents, vacancy, expenses, and financing** ripple through the model.  
- Be aware of **adjacent terms, alternative conventions, and debates** in the industry.

## Deliverables  

1. **Guide Files**  
   - Generate the guide as **separate Markdown files**, one per logical layer of the pyramid.  
   - Each Markdown file must be **complete, polished, and free of placeholders**.  
   - Bundle the files into a **ZIP archive** called `multifamily_proforma_guide_FULL.zip`.  

2. **README.md**  
   - Generate a `README.md` at the root of the package with:  
     - A short introduction to the guide.  
     - A **Table of Contents** linking to each part.  
     - A summary of features (e.g., Key Terms, Excel equivalents, references).  
     - End goals of the guide.  
     - Instructions on how to use (read in sequence, apply Excel equivalents, etc.).  
     - License disclaimer (educational purposes only).  

3. **Optional Add-ons**  
   - Optionally, also generate a **single consolidated Markdown file** or **PDF** for continuous reading.
